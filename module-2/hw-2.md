Introduction
The (E)UTxO-Model and Marlowe Contracts
Using Daedalus
Marlowe Run
The Marlowe Playground

Cardano Blockchain is UTxO model.
"Unspent Transaction Output (UTxO)"
Example Alice 100 ADA, gives 10 to Bob.
Alice 100 ADA > [Tx1] > Alice 90 ADA, Bob 10 ADA.

Marlowe smart contracts have a transaction (UTxO), and state of contract (decision made), then recorded to the blockchain.
